### Professionalism:
- Take Responsibility
- Do not Harm Functionality and Structure
- Work Ethic
- Know your Field
- Continuous Learning
- Practice
- Collaboration
- Mentoring
- Know Basic Business Domain of the Software

### Saying No:
- Do; or do not. There is no trying
- The higher the stakes, the more valuable no becomes
- If your “trying” does not lead to the desired outcome, you will have failed
- If you don’t have a new plan, if you don’t make a change to your behavior, if you do everything exactly as you would have before you promised to “try,” then what does trying mean?
- The temptation to be a hero and “solve the problem” is huge

### Saying Yes:
- Say. Mean. Do.

### Coding:
- typing blind is all about confidence
- If you are tired or distracted, do not code
- the worst of all is saying you are done when you know you aren’t
- It is unprofessional to remain stuck when help is easily accessible.

### Test Driven Development:
- GOTO is harmful
- TDD works
THE THREE LAWS OF TDD
i. You are not allowed to write any production code until you have first written a failing unit test
ii. You are not allowed to write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail—and not compiling is failing
iii. You are not allowed to write more production code that is sufficient to pass the currently failing unit test
- the tests you write after the fact are defense. The tests you write first are offense

- Wasa is very much like a two-man kata.
- One programmer writes a unit test, and then the other must make it pass. Then they reverse roles.
- BROADENING YOUR EXPERIENCE
i. Open Source
ii. if you are a Java programmer, contribute to a Rails project. If you write a lot of C++ for your employer, find a Python project and contribute to it.
